			<h2>What is sideloading?</h2>
			<p>Sideloading is the process of installing programs onto a device through sources other than the ones given
				by the device manufacturer.</p>
			<p>Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed, AKA, 'approved' before launching on your device.</p>
			<p>Applications can be signed in two ways.</p>
			<p> 1. Use of personal Apple ID (Free)<br>
				2. Use of external App Signing services (Some free / Some paid)
			</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p>The following guide will be covering the first method, using a free Apple ID to install apps with a Mac
				or PC.</p>
			<p>This method has a limit of 3 apps per Apple ID, and apps must be resigned after 7 days.</p>
			<p>To sideload apps without a PC or 7 day limits, consider using a
				<a href="signingservices.html">signing service.</a>
			</p>

			<h2>Sideloading applications with Apple ID</h2>

			<p>Things you'll need:<br><br>
				1. Free Apple account (can use burner)<br>
				2. PC or Mac computer<br>
				3. <a href="https://sideloadly.io/">Sideloadly</a>
			</p>

			<p>To begin, you need to download the iOS application that you want to install.</p>
			<p>iOS applications are packaged as IPA files and can be found from many sources.</p>
			<p>For this guide, we will be installing the Provenance Emulator from <a
					href="https://provenance-emu.com/">Provenance-emu.com</a> as an example.</p>
			<p>Download the IPA (the iOS application) file to your computer.</p>

			<p>Once you have Sideloadly installed on your Mac/PC, launch the program.</p>
			<p>Sign in with the Apple ID you wish to use (a burner account is fine), and make sure your device is
				selected in the top menu pictured below.</p>
			<img src="../images/sideloadly.png" alt="Sideloadly Configuration" class="responsive">
			<p>Once these steps are compelete, simply drag your IPA file into Sideloadly and the program will do the
				rest!</p>
			<p>After sideloadly has installed your app, you must trust the sideloaded application from your settings app
				so it will launch on your device.</p>
			<p>Navigate to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management to trust your app, as pictured below.</p>
			<img src="../images/trustprofile.png" alt="Trust profile in settings" class="responsive">
			<p>Once you have trusted your app, you are done! Enjoy your new sideloaded application!</p>
			<p>Note - Apps installed with this method must be resigned every 7 days. To do this, simply drag the app
				back into Sideloadly and it will resign it for you.</p>
			<p>You will not lose any data, the app will simply refresh and begin launching as normal again.</p>
