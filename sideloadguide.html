	<h1>What is sideloading?</h1>
	<p>Sideloading is the process of installing programs onto a device through sources other than the ones given by the device manufacturer.</p>
	<p>Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed, AKA, 'approved' before launching on your device.</p>
	<p>Applications can be signed in two ways.</p>
	<p>	1. Use of personal Apple ID (Free)<br>
		2. Use of external App Signing services (Some free / Some paid)
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>The following guide will be covering the first method, using a free Apple ID to install apps with a Mac or PC.</p>
	<p>This method has a limit of 3 apps per Apple ID, and apps must be resigned after 7 days.</p>
	<p>To sideload apps without a PC or 7 day limits, consider using a

	<h1>Sideloading applications with Apple ID</h1>

	<p>Things you'll need:<br><br>
		1. Free Apple account (can use burner)<br>
		2. PC or Mac computer<br>
		3. <a href="https://sideloadly.io/">Sideloadly</a>
	</p>

	<p>To begin, you need to download the iOS application that you want to install.</p>
	<p>iOS applications are packaged as IPA files and can be found from many sources.</p>
	<p>For this guide, we will be using <a href="https://appdb.to/">appdb.to</a> as an example.</p>
	<p>Find the app you want to install on AppDB, and download the IPA file to your computer.</p>

	<p>Once you have Sideloadly installed on your Mac/PC, launch the program.</p>
	<p>Sign in with the Apple ID you wish to use (a burner account is fine), and make sure your device is selected in the top menu pictured below.</p>

	<p>Once these steps are compelete, simply drag your IPA file into Sideloadly and the program will do the rest!</p>
	<p>After sideloadly has installed your app, you must trust the sideloaded application from your settings app so it will launch on your device.</p>
	<p>Navigate to Settings > General > VPN & Device Management to trust your app, as pictured below.</p>

	<p>Once you have trusted your app, you are done! Enjoy your new sideloaded application!</p>
	<p>Note - Apps installed with this method must be resigned every 7 days. To do this, simply drag the app back into Sideloadly and it will resign it for you.</p>
	<p>You will not lose any data, the app will simply refresh and begin launching as normal again.</p>
