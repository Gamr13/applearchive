	<h1>What is sideloading?</h1>
	<p>Sideloading is the process of installing programs onto a device through sources other than the ones given by the device manufacturer.</p>
	<p>Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed, AKA, 'approved' before launching on your device.</p>
	<p>Applications can be signed in two ways.</p>
	<p>	1. Use of personal Apple ID (Free)<br>
		2. Use of external App Signing services (Some free / Some paid)
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>The following guide will be covering the first method, using a free Apple ID to install apps with a Mac or PC.</p>
	<p>This method has a limit of 3 apps per Apple ID, and apps must be resigned after 7 days.</p>
	<p>To sideload apps without a PC or 7 day limits, consider using a
