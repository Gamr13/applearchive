	<h1>What is sideloading?</h1>
	<p>Sideloading is the process of installing programs onto a device through sources other than the ones given by the device manufacturer.</p>
	<p>In this case, Apple only allows app installations exclusively from the App Store. However, there are ways to get around such limitations.</p>
	<p>Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed, AKA, 'approved' before launching on your device.</p>
	<p>Sideloading is exactly this: getting an app signed so it will install on your device.</p>
	<p>Applications can be signed in two ways.</p>
	<p>
	1. Use of personal Apple ID (Free)<br>
	2. Use of external App Signing services (Some free / Some paid)
	</p>
