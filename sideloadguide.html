	<h1>Complete Guide to Sideloading Applications on iOS</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>What is sideloading?</h2>
	<p>Sideloading is the process of installing programs onto a device through sources other than the ones given by the device manufacturer. <br>
	In this case, Apple only allows app installations exclusively from the App Store. However, there are ways to get around such limitations.<br>
	Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed, AKA, 'approved' before launching on your device.<br>
	This is different from other platforms such as android, which allows users to install any application, regardless of being signed or 'approved'.
	</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Why would I want to sideload apps?</h2>

	<p>
	Apple has strict limitations and guidelines regarding the things they allow in the Appstore.<br>
	If a developer doesn’t comply with these guidelines they will either be rejected from the App Store or get their app taken down later upon review. <br>
	Also, applications are often removed from the Appstore by the developers themselves for various reasons.<br>
	These reasons can include no longer supporting the app, ownership change,<br>
	and commonly, to introduce a new version of the app with a subscription based payment model.<br>
	With sideloading, you can install any app of your choosing.
	</p>

	<h3>Removed Games</h3>
	<p>Remember Flappy Bird? What about jelly car?<br>
		There are great classic games that have been removed by the developers for various reasons.<br>
		With sideloading, you can install all of these games again.
	</p>

	<h3>Gaming consoles in your pocket.</h3>
	<p>
	Believe it or not, you can play games from all sorts of classic gaming systems on your iOS device.
	<br>Apple doesn't allow these kind of applications in the Appstore. <br>
	With sideloading you can install these apps and play thousands of classic games on your device for completely free.<br>
	There are many great emulators for iOS.<br><br>
	A few emulators that stand out are

	<h2> So how do I sideload applications on my iOS device? </h2>

<h3>What is a signing service?</h3>

	<p>
	A signing service is an application or website that provides applications for the user to install.
	<br>These applications include but are not limited to jailbreaking apps, tweaked apps, tweaked games, paid games, etc.
	<br>
	Signing services work on all devices on all iOS versions.
	<br>
	No computer is required.
