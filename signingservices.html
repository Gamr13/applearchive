	<h3>What is a signing service?</h3>

	<p>A signing service is an application or website that provides applications for the user to install.</p>
	<p>These applications include but are not limited to: jailbreaking tools, modified apps with additional features, mods for games, ad removal from apps, etc.</p>
	<p>Signing services work on all devices on all iOS versions.
	<p>No computer is required.</p>

	<h2>Paid Signing Services</h2>
	<p>Paid signing services deliver the best experience overall.</p>
	<p>Paid signing services typically include a large catalog of pre-signed apps, the ability
	 to sign any custom app, and instant replacement in case Apple revokes an app.</p>
	<p>There is no 7 day limit, unlike the free method with an Apple ID. No computer needed either, you can sideload apps directly on your device. 
	Price varies depending on which signing service you choose.</p>
