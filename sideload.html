<h2>What is sideloading?</h2>
<p>Sideloading is the process of installing programs onto a device through sources other than the ones given by the device manufacturer. <br>
	In this case, Apple only allows app installations exclusively from the App Store. However, there are ways to get around such limitations.<br>
	Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed, AKA, 'approved' before launching on your device.<br>
	This is different from other platforms such as android, which allows users to install any application, regardless of being signed or 'approved'.
